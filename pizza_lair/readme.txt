This project is a website for a pizza company called Pizza Lair.
The purpose of the website is ordering pizzas in the most simple way.
On the website you can see the pizza menu and offers.
To go further you have to register or login to your account.
When you are logged you can see the details for the pizzas and make an order.
It is not possible to order an offer just look at it.

- The populationscript.sql for the database


The public ID for the database is: 35.228.253.190

To get the website up and running you have to make sure venv package installed.
Then you can activate the venv, run the program and get the website.

Before we started this project we wrote down some programming rules.
Some of the rules that we followed are:
- Having the variable names and descriptive as possible.
- We tested the code frequently to prevent major coding errors.
